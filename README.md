# 🔐 Password Generator

## 🎯 Objective
A simple Python project that generates secure random passwords with customizable length and complexity. The password includes a mix of letters, digits, and special characters to ensure security.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Core logic and random generation)

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Random module (`random.choice()`)
- String manipulation
- User input handling (`input()`)

## 🕹️ How It Works
- The user specifies the desired password length and optionally the inclusion of special characters.
- The program generates a secure password using random selections from different character sets (letters, digits, symbols).
- The generated password is displayed to the user.

## 💡 Highlights
- Customizable password length and complexity.
- Random generation ensures a strong, secure password.
- Useful for improving understanding of randomization and string manipulation in Python.
